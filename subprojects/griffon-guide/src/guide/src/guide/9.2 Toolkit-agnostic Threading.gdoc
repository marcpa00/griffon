Swing is not the only toolkit supported by Griffon. For those additional toolkits the three methods exposed in the previous sections (edt, doLater, doOutside) make no sense, however running code inside the UI thread in a synchronous/asynchronous way, as well as outside of it is something you must keep in mind.

The following sections outline toolkit-agnostic threading options, which can also be used with Swing in case you're wondering. These methods are available to all classes that implement the [griffon.core.ThreadingHandler|api:griffon.core.ThreadingHandler], such as [griffon.core.GriffonArtifact|api:griffon.core.GriffonArtifact] and [griffon.core.GriffonApplication|api:griffon.core.GriffonApplication] interfaces.
