Section 4.7.9 describes that copies of plugins and archetypes will be placed in a local repository whenever they are downloaded from other repositories. You can disable this feature altogether by specifying a value for @griffon.disable.local.repository.sync@ as true, like the following example shows

{code}
griffon -Dgriffon.disable.local.repository.sync=true install-archetype scala
{code}
